# Nathan's nvim setup

Hello, Nathan, it is I...your editor.  I must say that initially I was very
impressed with your use of vimscript. However, lately, I must conclude that it
is 2024 and it is time to get with the times.

## Dependencies

```
* ripgrep (for telescope)
* pyright (for python's lsp)
```
